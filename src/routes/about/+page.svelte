<h1 class="text-2xl mb-5">About Me</h1>
<p class="mb-3">
	Hey there, I'm Zortrox, just a guy with a bunch of cool interests and roles in life. I spend my
	days working as a programmer, where I love to mess around with programming and electronics
	projects, especially Raspberry Pis and other self-hosted software. It's all about having fun and
	learning as I go.
</p>
<p class="mb-3">
	When I'm off the clock, you'll often find me immersed in Warframe, League of Legends, or Guild
	Wars 2 (or whatever other game I'm hyper-fixating on). I'm also a dedicated family man, cherishing
	the quality time I spend with my wife and daughter, whether it's gaming (video or board games),
	spending time outdoors, or visiting imaginary worlds.
</p>
<p class="mb-3">
	Beyond that, I'm a fan of science fiction and fantasy books and find peace in the great outdoors
	through activities like hiking and swimming. I also love Dungeons & Dragons, where I get to let my
	creativity run wild (even though I don't play as often as I want). So, yeah, I'm just a regular
	guy with a mix of interests and roles, and it's all about having a good time and sharing the joy
	with others.
